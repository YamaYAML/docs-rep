# The Tavern

<The Tavern> is at it's heart a social guild. We aim to be your home away from home and to better your day by spending time with good friends and better people. To that end we strive for a relaxed, friendly, and inviting community. To reach those goals we have the following list of rules:

## 1. Don't be a jerk.

Yeah, that's pretty much it. Being a jerk is a broad stroke term that encompasses anything (verbal, physical, emotional, etc.) that might lessen another player's gaming experience. The guild is made up of mostly adults that have some life experiences behind them, so it should be pretty obvious what not to do.

Rule #1 applies not only to other guild members but also the the rest of the server. We are working towards a positive reputation on the server and would much rather be known for our generosity and kindness than showing up and wrecking people's day.

Our members have shown that we will not stand for toxic behavior and if you prove yourself to be a jerk you will be removed from the guild very quickly. We play this game to have fun, so let's have a good time together.
